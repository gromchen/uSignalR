# uSignalR
SignalR which works in Unity3D

Origin of this repo is [here](https://github.com/jenyayel/SignalR.Client.20).
Event signals are substituted with [uTasks](https://github.com/gromchen/uTasks).
Code was changed as close as possible to version 1.2.2 of [official SignalR repo](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR).
Current version works with PC, iOS and Android for sure.
It does not work with web player since web sockets are not implemented here yet.
